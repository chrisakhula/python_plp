Rules for Naming Python Variables

Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_)
Create a name that makes sense. For example, vowel makes more sense than v.

If you want to create a variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them.

Python is case-sensitive. So num and Num are different variables.

Avoid using keywords like if, True, class, etc. as variable names.
